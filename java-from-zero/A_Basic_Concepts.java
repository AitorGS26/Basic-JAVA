/*
 * Welcome to the First lesson on this personal course of Java.
 
 * First of all, when we're coding we've to know that the appropiate form
 for reading code is up to down and from right to left. This is very important
 for knowing what a code does.
 
 * When we start coding on Java, we've to know a very important thing,
 I like to explain like a friend explained to me. If we look at programming
 like a way to create something, in java for create that thing,
 what we've to do is to create the "machine" which creates that thing we
 want to create.

 THE MAIN METHOD

 * The MAIN mehod. This is where all begins, as we can see below,
 our code always start with a public class "name of the class".
 We have to take this as the start of the code, but for running our
 future code, we've to set a MAIN method, that usually is the following:
 
 public static void main (String[] args){
 }
 This say's to the program that is a java program and can run.

 PRINTING CODE

 * Now we've setted the code below for start running, but what can we do for 
 running some code, for this also we've to say to the program "hey I want
 to print something", and for this we've the following code:
 system.out.print("text for print");
 system.out.println("text to print")

 IMPORTANT NOTE: IN JAVA WE'VE TO END THE INSTUCTION WITH ; ALWAYS
 Also is important to know, the name of the class will start with a
 capital letter.
