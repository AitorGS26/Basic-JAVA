/*
 * Welcome to the First lesson on this personal course of Java.
 
 * First of all, we've to know that the appropiate form
 for reading code is from right to left & up to down. This is very important
 for knowing what code does.
 
 * When we start coding Java, we've to know a very important thing,
 I like to explain like a friend explained to me. If we look at programming
 like a way to create something, in java for create that thing,
 we've to create the "machine" which creates the thing we
 want to create.

 THE MAIN METHOD

 * We have to take this as the start of the code. In java the program won't run if the MAIN
 method is not setted. This is always inside a public class, for allow running the program.
 
 public static void main (String[] args){
 }


 PRINTING CODE

 * By now we've the public class and the main method and because of that we know
 the program will run, now we've to tell the program something for showing something to
 the user, we've to print the code and for that we've the following lines
 
 system.out.print("text for print"); -> the text is printed in the same line
 system.out.println("text to print") -> the text is printed in the next line

 IMPORTANT NOTE: IN JAVA WE'VE TO END THE INSTUCTION WITH ; ALWAYS
 Also is important to know, the name of the class will start with a
 capital letter.
